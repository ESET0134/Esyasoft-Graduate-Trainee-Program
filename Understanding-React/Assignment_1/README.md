# Assignment 1

Goal: Practice components, props, state, and console logging using a minimal counter.

Requirements:

1. Create a reusable Button component that accepts two props: label and onClick.
2. In App, display a count that starts at 0 and two buttons: Increment and Decrement.
3. Log each click to the console using console.log so it can be seen in Browser DevTools.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Clicking Increment increases the count by 1; clicking Decrement decreases it by 1 (no negative restriction required).
2. Console shows a message per click (e.g., "Increment clicked‚Äù).
3. The same Button component is reused for both actions.
