# Assignment 5

Build a Theme Switcher App using React Context.
 
Requirements:

1. Create a ThemeContext with two themes: light and dark.
2. Wrap the app with ThemeContext.Provider.
3. Have a button “Toggle Theme” that switches between light and dark.
4. Display some text (e.g., “Hello Students!”) that changes style based on the active theme.
 
        Light → white background, black text
        Dark → black background, white text.
