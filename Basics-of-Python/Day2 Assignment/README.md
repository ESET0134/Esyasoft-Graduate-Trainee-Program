DAY 2 ASSIGNMENT

Question:
    
    Create a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a point with (X,Y) co-ordinates. For example,
    points = [(1,2),(5,8),(3,4)],
    Write a for loop to iterate through this list. For each tuple, unpack the X and Y values into seperate variables. 
    Use a conditional statement to check if the X co-ordinates is greater than the Y co-ordinate.
    If X>Y, 
        print "The X co-ordinate is greater than the Y co-ordinate for point (X,Y)."
    Otherwise,
        print "The Y co-ordinate is greater than or equal to the X co-ordinate for point (X,Y)."

Output:
    
    The Y coordinate is greater than or equal to the X coordinate for point (1,2).
    The Y coordinate is greater than or equal to the X coordinate for point (5,8).
    The Y coordinate is greater than or equal to the X coordinate for point (3,4).
    The X coordinate is greater than the Y coordinate for point (10,5).
    The Y coordinate is greater than or equal to the X coordinate for point (7,7).
