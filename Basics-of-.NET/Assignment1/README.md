Question:

Develop a console-based banking application that allows a user to interact with a virtual bank account using a menu-driven interface. The user can create an account by providing an account number and holder name, and then perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing account details. The program ensures that only valid operations are allowed-for example, withdrawals cannot exceed the available balance, and negative amounts are not accepted.
